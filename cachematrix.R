### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
##benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
##repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special
##"matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
##already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
##`cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
